This implies that a significant portion of plastic waste in the US is not being properly disposed of or recycled, leading to environmental pollution and potential harm to ecosystems and human health.\n\nHere's a detailed markdown table for all the data shown:\n\n| Region | Landfilled (2019) | Mismanaged (2019) | Incinerated (2019) | Recycled (2019) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| World | 49% | 22% | 19% | 9% |\n| United States | 73% | 4% | 19% | 4% |\n| Europe | 44% | 6% | 38% | 12% |\n| Asia (excluding China and India) | 39% | 34% | 19% | 8% |\n\nNote: The data source for this information is the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), and the percentages represent the share of plastic waste that is recycled, landfilled, incinerated, and mismanaged in each region in 2019."
