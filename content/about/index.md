# Qwen Team

The Qwen team aims at chasing artificial general intelligence and now focuses on building generalist models, including large language models and large multimodal models. We embrace opensource and previously we have released the Qwen model series, including the language models, e.g., Qwen-7B , Qwen-14B, and Qwen-72B, as well as their chat models, and multimodal models, such as Qwen-VL and Qwen-Audio. Additionally, we have built web service and APP for users to benefit from the assistance of Qwen for your daily work and life. We are a group of people with diverse talents and interests. Feel free to chat with us and welcome to join us!
