The problem asks to calculate the surface area and volume of these figures.\n\n1. For the rectangular prism:\n- Length (l) = 4 cm\n- Width (w) = 2 cm\n- Height (h) = 3 cm\n\nSurface Area (SA) of a rectangular prism = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\nVolume (V) of a rectangular prism = lwh\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nSA = 2(4cm)(2cm) + 2(4cm)(3cm) + 2(2cm)(3cm)\nSA = 16cm² + 24cm² + 12cm²\nSA = 52cm²\n\nV = (4cm)(2cm)(3cm)\nV = 24cm³\n\n2. For the cube:\n- Side length (a) = 3 dm\n\nSurface Area (SA) of a cube = 6a²\nVolume (V) of a cube = a³\n\nSubstituting the given value:\nSA = 6(3dm)²\nSA = 6(9dm²)\nSA = 54dm²\n\nV = (3dm)³\nV = 27dm³\n\nSo, the surface area and volume for each figure are as follows:\n\nFor the rectangular prism:\n- Surface Area = 52 cm²\n- Volume = 24 cm³\n\nFor the cube:\n- Surface Area = 54 dm²\n- Volume = 27 dm³"
